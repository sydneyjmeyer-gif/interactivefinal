                <p>Mark T. Skinner West Elementary School has a problem.</p>
                
                <p>In an era of chronic underenrollment, the West Loop school averages more than 135 students per class from kindergarten through sixth grade, but once seventh grade hits, enrollment numbers plummet by almost half.</p>
                
                <p>"You know what Academic Centers are?" said Tina Punjabi, the mother of a Skinner West first grader, when asked where all the middle schoolers go, "A lot of them go there."</p>
                
                <p>It's not unreasonable to ask if one knows what an Academic Center is. There are only seven in all of Chicago Public Schools. Selective Prep, a Chicago based test prep company describes them as "some of the Chicago Public Schools' best kept secrets," according to its website.</p>
                
                <iframe src="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/ca7990255a42df94a8ca9fdaf012e876/chicago-public-schools-academic-centers/index.html" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>
                
                <p>But one of the seven is just a block away from Skinner West, at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School.</p>
                
                <p>Widely regarded as one of the highest performing schools in the state of Illinois, acceptance into Whitney Young is highly competitive. If a student is accepted into the Academic Center for their seventh grade year, they're guaranteed a spot until they graduate high school.</p>
                
                <p>This is especially enticing since students in Academic Centers are able to circumnavigate Chicago Public School's High School Assessment Test altogether, avoiding the dizzying, even-more competitive high school enrollment process that awaits most CPS eighth graders.</p>
                
                <p>While many Chicago residents believe this process begins when their student enters fifth grade, the year a child's transcript, along with test scores from the Academic Center Entrance Exam will be submitted for their consideration. This process may actually begin years earlier, before a child even begins kindergarten.</p>
                
                <p>A WBEZ report from earlier this summer found that eighth grade students in selective enrollment elementary programs are three times more likely to attend selective enrollment high schools than students in CPS neighborhood elementary programs.</p>
                
                <p>Acceptance into selective enrollment elementary schools requires parents to volunteer their four-year-olds for IQ testing. This rewards parents who are familiar with a school system they've yet to enter, and bases acceptance off nebulous data, according to a 2021 study from the International Journal of Educational Research Open.</p>
                
                <p>The WBEZ analysis does not include data on students attending Academic Centers, and CPS says they do not collect data on students accepted into Academic Centers.</p>
                
                <p>While many CPS elementary schools provide testing prep to students for the High School Admissions Test, they are far less likely to provide prep for the Academic Center Entrance Exam, according to Charlie Howard, founder of Chicago Test Prep.</p>
                
                <p>Howard's company offers prep classes for both entrance exams. While he estimates around 70 elementary schools use his services to prep students for the HSAT, only three hire him to prep students for the ACEE.</p>
                
                <p>"The elementary schools don't generally want us holding our courses at the school because they don't want their students leaving after 6th grade." Howard said.</p>
                
                <p>Grace Sawin, founder of education consulting business Chicago School GPS, commonly sees parents dealing with the chaos and stress surrounding access to elite CPS schools. She assures her clients everything will pan out.</p>
                
                <p>"There are other good high schools out there, they just aren't the ones you hear about in the news," Sawin said.</p>
                
                <p>Still, Sawin will readily admit that when her own daughter was accepted into a highly selective Academic Center, she sent her without thinking twice.</p>
